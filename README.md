## Machine Learning Experiment Tracking and Deployment with MLflow

This project showcases the full cycle of a machine learning pipeline, focusing on **experiment tracking, model deployment, and containerization**. The combination of **MLflow** for tracking, **Flask** for serving, and **Docker** for seamless execution makes it a powerful and efficient solution.

### Experiment Tracking with MLflow:
- Effortlessly log and track **experiments, metrics, and models** using MLflow.
- Gain insights into model performance with detailed logs of each experiment iteration.
- Keep track of model improvements, and compare metrics over time to ensure the best-performing model is deployed.

### Model Deployment:
- Save your trained model and associated encoders with **joblib** for efficient loading during prediction.
- Build an intuitive **Flask web application** to allow users to submit inputs and receive predictions instantly.
- From user inputs to real-time predictions, the web app provides a smooth and interactive experience.

### Dockerfile:
- Simplify model deployment with Docker. Forget about manually setting up environments and libraries!
- Simply pull the Docker image from DockerHub, and run the model in a **completely self-contained environment**.
- No need to worry about dependencies or package installationâ€”just **copy and paste the DockerHub link** (available at the end of the notebook) into your terminal, and the model is ready to go!


## This is a Basic End-to-End Diabetes Prediction Model

The notebook provides a comprehensive example of a machine learning pipeline, from data exploration to deployment, enabling users to understand and replicate the process for similar tasks, especially focusing on diabetes prediction based on patient features.

### Pull Image from DockerHub:  
**docker pull orhfusion/diabetes-predict-model**

*Run without installing any dependencies & no need to create an environment for it...*
